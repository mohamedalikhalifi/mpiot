# mpiot
This mini project is aiming at exploring the different technologies learned during the course of MP2L studies (devops, ML, SOA, containarisation, etc. ). It consits of a Raspberry PI3 module equipped with a camera module to provide building access authorization based on facial recognition. The idea is to have different microservices programmed in python (or other as needed)
providing the recognition, authorization and notification, services. those microservices will be contained inside of docker images and communicating with each other to provide the desired service.
